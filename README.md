# Introduction to Shader Graph: Crossfade Transition
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to smoothly change your VRoid character’s textures through the use of Shader Graph in Unity. We’re going to make our own crossfade transition and modify the MToon Shader used in the UniVRM plugin. If you have no prior experience to it, this tutorial is also an introduction to Shader Graph. 

Huge credit to these guys who made this possible!
