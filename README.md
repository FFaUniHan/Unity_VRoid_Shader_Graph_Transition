# Introduction to Shader Graph: Crossfade Transition
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to smoothly change your VRoid characterâ€™s textures through the use of Shader Graph in Unity. We're going to make our first shader together, our own Crossfade Transition shader, animate them, modify the UniVRM shaders, and learn how to swap between three or more textures! If you have no prior experience to it, this tutorial is also an introduction to Shader Graph. 

Huge credit to these guys who made this possible!
